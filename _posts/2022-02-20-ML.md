# What is Artificial Intelligence?
<t>In recent years, almost everyone whose major is CS or even seems like not actually related to computers is talking about, or studying Artificial Intelligence(AI). In this era AI, I think it is really important to distinguish what is AI, Machine Learning(ML), and Deep Learning(DL). AI represents any technique that enables computers to mimic human behavior, ML means an ability to learn without explicitly being programmed, and DL is extracting patterns from data using deep neural networks.
